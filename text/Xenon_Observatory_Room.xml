	I scan the room first before heading in. Ranfa doesn't seem to be in this room, and on future inspection, this is almost identical to the hospital room.
	There's another 90s era computer, but I notice a telescope in the middle of the room.
	Didn't Ranfa say that there was an observatory room on this ship?
	I guess she was trying to make some sort of joke or something.

	    I inspect the room for anything interesting.
	    I wouldn't call this a hospital room since they're only one bed instead of the multiple beds in the other hospital room.
	    There's also this curtain to the left. Let's open it.
	    As I try to open the curtain, a wave starts to appear on the curtain. Almost as if there's a hologram of a curtain instead.
	    I also can't really move past it either. I try with all my might, but It doesn't budge. Damn.
