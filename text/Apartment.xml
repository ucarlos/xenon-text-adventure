As I walk back home, I remember that I need to buy groceries for the week.
After making sure to buy various meats and vegetables, I return to my apartment and whip up some Chicken Fajitas, enough for me and Megumi, should she decide to visit.
It's been almost a week since she's been here. I guess her job is keeping her busy.
In any case, I should think about what I should do right now.
