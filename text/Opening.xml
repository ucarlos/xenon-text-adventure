	For the last few weeks, I've had the same dream over and over.
	I find myself asleep not in my normal room, but in some hospital room. Or rather, something like a hospital room.
	The first thing I notice is a 90s era computer on the left of the bed, complete with a CRT monitor, floppy disk drive and key switch on the keyboard.
	The room feels quite professional, as there's a collection of books, most of which are not in any language I can recognize.
	I do notice that there's a poster of what appears to be a human, limbs and all. But all of this clashes with the sleek, steel walls that make up the room.
	It has this sort of spaceship like feel, almost as if I'm in some sort of Science fiction movie.
	Still, when try to investigate outside of the room, I begin to feel this pain in my body that quickly gets worse and worse.

	If I try to go through the room, I suddenly wake up, back in my regular room.

	You should not be able to access this scene. Why? Because there is no more
	scenes in this room. None. You should fix your shit, because this room doesn't
	lead anywhere.
