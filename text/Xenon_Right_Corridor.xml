	As I walk through the right corridor, I quickly notice that it's an almost mirror image of the left corridor, save a non-neglected potted plant and a vending machine. I also notice a room at the end of the corridor. I know that Ranfa walked through here, yet I have no idea what room she went into. I should explore this place.

	    Dammit, this room's locked. There's no keypad on this door, but there's a card reader instead. I obviously don't have the card for this room, so I can't get it.
